Website : My Portfolio WebSite Using ASP.NET Core

# Portfolio

Questin: Describe roles authentication and authorization related to the theme/website.
         which controllers did you decide to force authentication & authorization and why?

Answer: I have given my portfolio website permission to create material for reference controllers and recommendation menus as referrers to users visiting the website.
        On my website, menus related to my skills and menus about my experience can be viewed by users, but cannot be edited or deleted.
        I have limited the functions of Create controller, Edit which controller, and Delete controller to be used only when logged in.
        However, users can view the my Portfolio website even if they are not logged in.
        The reason for this classification by role is so that users who visit my portfolio website can see my career and education, but cannot edit or delete it.
        However, I gave permission to freely write recommendations and reference menus so that my professors group, my co-workers, 
        and friends among my portfolio website visitors can recommend me. However, if you want to delete it, you are restricted to logging in.
